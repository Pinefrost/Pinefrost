Hello, I am Pine and I am starting to learn how this website works so God help me lol. Anyway, I already gave you a little info on me. I can code in HTML, Block, and CSS.
I am planning on learning more since I would like to be a Video Game Designer in the future. I think I will start learning JS, prob sometime soon. I'll probably learn on Code.org.
Anyways I already code on Scratch, I do some pretty good animations and projects, hoping to improve more. I am currently working on bigger projects so if you want to see those, link is in my profile.
I post on Tiktok if u wanna see my face, link also in my profile. I am also on Discord, again link in my profile. Ofc I go to school so I won't be on a whole lot.
Also again, I'm still learning this app so I really don't know anything, feel free to let me know some basics.
